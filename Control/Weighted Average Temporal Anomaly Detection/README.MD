# Temporal Anomaly Detection (WEIGHTED AVERAGE) Using Different Thresholds

Within the Control/Weighted Average Temporal Anomaly Detection repository, there will be three different folders consisting of sub-folders that consist of figures (comprised of a time-series plot of 
the eigenvalue vectors and an outlier detection signals plot) that correspond to each NumPy array in the Control group and were generated with different 'window,'and
'threshold' values.

These three folders will be titled **"threshold = 2.0"**,**"threshold = 2.5,"** and **"threshold = 3.0"** as I experimented with these three threshold values. Within each of these three folders, I experiment with different
window sizes **(15,20,50)** and there will be different sub-folders titled with the corresponding window.
