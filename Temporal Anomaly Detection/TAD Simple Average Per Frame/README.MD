# Original Temporal Anomaly Detection (Utilizing Simple Average Eigenvalue Per Frame)
Within the "TAD Simple Average Per Frame" repository, I have included my code for the temporal anomaly detection, a *readaptation* of Marcus' original code. 

My code differs in that some arguments are left out from Marcus' code but this script should still be easily ran by anybody. 

My code file is titled, "temporal_anomaly_detection_code.py." This is the code I use to create the temporal anomaly detection plots for the eigenvalue NumPy arrays 
in each experimental group.
