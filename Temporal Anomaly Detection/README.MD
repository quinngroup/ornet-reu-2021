# Temporal Anomaly Detection

Within the "Temporal Anomaly Detection" repository, I have included my code for temporal anomaly detection, a *readaptation* of Marcus' original code. 

My code file is titled, "temporal_anomaly_detection_code.py." This is the code I use to create the temporal anomaly detection plots for the eigenvalue NumPy arrays in each experimental group. The **code for the temporal anomaly detection begins on line 86.** The code I created preceding line 86 was to import the npz files from my working directory into my Python editor.
