# Temporal Anomaly Detection

Within the "Temporal Anomaly Detection" repository, there are three folders. 

Two folders contain the code for both versions of the Temporal Anomaly Detection, that is, the TAD using the simple average eigenvalue per frame (original model) and the TAD using the weighted average eigenvalue per frame. These folders are titled, **"TAD Simple Average Per Frame"** and **"TAD Weighted Average Per Frame."**

In creating the new temporal anomaly detection code utilizing the weighted average eigenvalue per frame, I sought to compare both TAD models. Therefore, there is a folder titled, **"Comparing TAD Versions,"** which consists of code, tests, and plots that compare the two versions/models and the resultant raw data from those comparisons.
