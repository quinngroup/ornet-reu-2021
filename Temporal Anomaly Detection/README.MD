# Temporal Anomaly Detection

Within the "Temporal Anomaly Detection" repository, I have included my code for temporal anomaly detection, a *readaptation* of Marcus' original code. My code differs in that some arguments are left out from Marcus' code but this script should still be easily ran by anybody. 

**NOTE:** Within the temporal anomaly detection code, we are only considering the simple average per frame. 

My code file is titled, "temporal_anomaly_detection_code.py." This is the code I use to create the temporal anomaly detection plots for the eigenvalue NumPy arrays in each experimental group.
