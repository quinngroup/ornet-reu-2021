# Temporal Anomaly Detection

Within the "Temporal Anomaly Detection" repository, I have included my code for temporal anomaly detection, a **readaptation** of Marcus' original code. 

My code file is titled, "temporal_anomaly_detection_code.py." This is the code I use to create the temporal anomaly detection plots for the eigenvalue numpy arrays in each experimental group.
