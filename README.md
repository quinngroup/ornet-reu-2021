# OrNet: Spatiotemporal Analysis of Organelle Morphology
## Summer 2021 Population Biology of Infectious Diseases REU Site @ UGA
### Participant: Walter Avila. Mentor(s): Dr. Shannon Quinn & Dr. Frederick Quinn

This is the GitHub repository that contains all my work with Organellar Networks and Temporal Anomaly Detection from Summer 2021. This research project was made possible by the PopBio REU Site at the University of Georgia (http://reu.ecology.uga.edu/?p=1767). 

Overall, I continued development on the Temporal Anomaly Detection model in OrNet by implementing a new algorithim and compared the model's behavior under this new algorithim to the model's behavior under the previous algorithim. More information on OrNet can be found at https://github.com/quinngroup/ornet and https://bit.ly/3juDuiF.

There are **six** folders in this repository. 

The folders titled **"Control,""LLO," and "MDIVI"** refer to the mitochondrial conditions in which the HeLa cells used in previous OrNet experimentation were coerced and contain the explained variance and Temporal Anomaly detection plots I generated for each eigenvalue NumPy array. 

The folder titled **"Explained Variance,"** contains my Python code used to create the explained variance plots from the eigenvalue data.

The folder titled **"Images"**, contains images inserted in various README.MD files used throughout the repository.

The folder titled **"Temporal Anomaly Detection,"** contains my code for the two different Temporal Anomaly Detection models I worked with as well as the code used to compare both models and the resultant data and findings from those comparisons.
