# Temporal Anomaly Detection Using Different Thresholds

Within the MDIVI/Temporal Anomaly Detection repository, there will be two different folders consisting of sub-folders that consist of figures (comprised of a time-series plot of 
the eigenvalue vectors and an outlier detection signals plot) that correspond to each NumPy array in the Control group and were generated with different 'window,'and
'threshold' values.

These two folders will be titled **"threshold = 2.0"** and **"threshold = 2.5,"** as I experimented with these two threshold values. Within each of these two folders, I experiment with different
window sizes (15,20,50) and there will be different sub-folders titled with the corresponding window.
